# Terraform GCP Worklytics

A collection of Terraform submodules to support the Worklytics Tenant API using Google Cloud
Platform (GCP) resources.

- [Tenant API: authentication via Service Account](modules/sa_tenant_api_auth)
- [Tenant API: create a Psoxy Connection](modules/psoxy_connection)

The main use-case for these submodules is to create [Psoxy Connections] in Worklytics via its
[Tenant API].

After a successful Psoxy deployment (Data Source fully configured, Psoxy instance tested and
running), the last step should be to create the actual connection in the [Data Sources] section of
the Worklytics Web App. These submodules provide a way to automate this process.

See the [examples/create_psoxy_connections] for a complete usage example.
